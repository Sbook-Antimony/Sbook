What is the problem

  We noticed |cam-child-p|% of children in the Cameroon, and in the world
  could not complete education due to unfavorable conditions, and even many
  in favorable conditions had deficient curricula.

What is the solution

  To solve that problem, we create Sbook, a platform where:
  - students could easily profit of free notes and quizzes published
    by teachers, rating by starring them as to their quality
  - teachers could publish notes and quizzes, making them available to
    their school students and/or public.
  - Schools supporting teachers and students where the students could read
    notes from teachers.

  from schools

  - They will be rewarded according to their contribution to Sbook,
    from their ratings and activity
